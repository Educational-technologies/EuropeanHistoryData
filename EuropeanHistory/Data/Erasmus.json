  "summary": "Erasmus was an influential %{Northern Renaissance#The Northern Renaissance} #{Humanist} who pushed for internal reform of the Church in order to return to a simpler variety of Christianity based on early writings, absent of the more recent developments in Christian rituals and traditions, such as the Veneration of Saints. This is seen in his most famous satirical work, Praise of the Folly, written in 1509. Often said to have \"laid the egg that %{Luther#Luther's 95 Theses} hatched.\""
