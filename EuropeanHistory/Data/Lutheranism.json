  "summary": "Lutheranism is a branch of Protestantism that follows the teachings of Martin Luther. It is characterized by the belief in salvation through faith alone, a \"priesthood of all believers\", and the sole authority of the Bible. It follows two sacraments instead of the catholic churches seven; the eucharist and baptism. Regarding the Eucharist, Lutherans specifically follow the doctrine of #{consubstantiation}."
