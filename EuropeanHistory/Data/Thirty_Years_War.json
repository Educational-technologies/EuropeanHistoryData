  "summary": "The Thirty Years War was a conflict between the Catholic forces of the Holy Roman Empire and Spain against the various Protestant forces which opposed them. It started with the Bohemian phase and the Defenestration of Prague, in which various Catholic officials were thrown out of a window. The rebellious Bohemians were defeated, leading to the next Danish phase, pitting the Holy Roman Empire against the Lutheran Danes who were also defeated. This led into the Swedish Phase, which was an indecisive period of conflict involving the Lutheran Swedes led by Gustavus Adolphus. The final phase was the Franco-Swedish phase, in which the Catholic French joined the Lutheran Swedes to finally defeat the Holy Roman Empire."
